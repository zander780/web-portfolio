        <h2>Why I Like Nahko</h2>

        <p>Nahko Bear is the lead singer of Nahko And Medicince For The People. With a wordly-folk style music, the
            songs range from love songs to
            songs about indigenous activism, to an homage of the Grandfather Teachings (7 Feathers). Nahko has a
            down-to-earth style and approaches the world with the same teachings he shares in his music. Nahko is a true
            storyteller.</p>

        <h2>About Nahko And The Medicine People</h2>
        <p>Nahko was adopted and raised by a conservative caucasian family in Oregon. In his later teen years and as a
            young adult, Nahko went on a journey of self-discovery and purpose because he learned about his Puerto
            Rican, Indigenous, and Filipino ancestry. His music reflects Nahko's journey, discoveries, and insights and
            includes social and environmental advocacy.</p>
        <p>Nahko And Medicine For The People released their debut album in 2011, titled 'On the Verge'. 'Dark As Night',
            released in 2013, was the album that sparked the growth of the band's popularity. The album release led to
            festival spots and was featured in the Top Ten Billboard Heatseekers Chart.</p>
